## About Nando



## Usage overview

Nando is meant to be run after using a modified version of Pando. Pando in turn
interacts directly with 
[Seurat objects](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) and
[Signac](https://satijalab.org/signac/) workflows. 

There are many steps in the workflow. See our vignette for a worked example.
